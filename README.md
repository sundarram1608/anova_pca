# anova_pca
This repository contains all the files used for analysis of two different data sets.<br>
The techniques of *ANOVA & PCA* are leveraged in this exercise.<br>
The coding language used here is Python Programing.

## DataSet:
- Salary (SalaryData.csv).
- Education post 12th standard (Education-Post12thStandard.csv).
- Data Dictionary (Data Dictionary.xlsx).

## Code File: (.ipynb)
- code_file.ipynb

## Business Report: (.pdf)
- This report provides a detailed explanation on approach used, record inferences, insights and provide suitable business solutions.<br>
The techniques of Advanced Statistics that employs ANOVA, Exploratory Data Analysis & Principal Component Analysis are leveraged in this exercise.  

## Libraries used:
> pandas<br>

> numpy<br>

> seaborn<br>

> matplotlib.pyplot<br>

> scipy.stats<br>

> statsmodels.formula.api<br>

> statsmodels.stats.anova<br>

> sklearn.decomposition<br>

> factor_analyzer<br>

## How to run the code?
- Fork & Clone the repository
- Install the above libraries (virtual environment recommended) if not available using the command `pip install` in terminal
- Open the Code file and run all the cells. (Same Folder hierarchy as in repository to be used)
